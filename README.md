 Understanding data using statistics and visualizations.

### Steps Involved:
1. Cleaning data (Handling missing values, imputation)
2. Created histogram to check data distribution.
3. Created boxplot to check outliers.
4. Used histogram to check correlation between variables,
5. Made basic visualizations to understand data.
6. Encoded categorical data for applying algorithms. 

Tools Used:  Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Conclusions: 
1. The maximum income of applicant is 72,529 and minimum is 0 with average income 4,805.
2. We observe the minimum loan amount to be 28 and maximum loan amount to be 550.
